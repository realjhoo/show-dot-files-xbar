# Show Dot Files xbar Plugin
This is a simple xbar plugin to show hidden dot files (or hide them again) written in shell script, because I needed it... for reasons.

## Installation
First, this plugin assumes you have xbar, the bitbar reboot.
Assuming this is so, drop `showdotfiles.2m.sh` in your xbar `plugins` folder. Be sure to set the file to executables by entering `chmod +x showdotfiles.2m.sh` on the command line while in the directory where showdotfiles lives.

# xbar? Where can I get that?
You can find xbar at https://xbarapp.com
